"Analyzing large parametric studies can be cumbersome, especially when "
"dealing with numerous cases and parameters. To facilitate this process, "
"**foamlib** provides a post-processing module that allows users to analyze "
"and visualize the results of their parametric studies efficiently."

"The main idea is to gather all the post-processing files from different "

"The post-processing module also supports loading spatial data from OpenFOAM "
"cases, such as surface data or sets. OpenFOAM stores for each time name a "
"new file with the same name that contains the spatial data. These data can "
"be loaded into a dataframe using the `load_tables` function, which will "

"Generally, the `load_tables` functions should be stored in a separate file "
"and the resulting tables should be written to disk as e.g., CSV, feather, or"

" from the files and visualize it in a user-friendly manner."
